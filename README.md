# Rolando-s_way
This small project is meant to be used for reading csv files and and searching through the files, and using user input to find information
This project is meant only for SCUC Technology but if you find it useful you are more than welcome to use the code. A gcc compilor is needed for this code to be compiled.
I will provide a makeFile for the purposes of compiling.
